Support libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`See this section <label-install-required-support-libraries>` for
information about the CLI options for the support libraries described
in this section.

The following are command line options for the support libraries that
are used by Open MPI that can be used with ``configure``:

* ``--with-hwloc[=VALUE]``:
* ``--with-libevent[=VALUE]``:
* ``--with-pmix[=VALUE]``:
* ``--with-prrte[=VALUE]``: These four options specify where to find
  the headers and libraries for the Hwloc, Libevent, PMIx, and PRRTE
  libraries, respectively.  The following ``VALUE``\s are permitted:

  * ``external``: Use an external installation (rely on default
    compiler and linker paths to find it).  ``configure`` will abort
    if it cannot find suitable header files and libraries.
  * ``internal``: Use Open MPI's internal/bundled copy.
  * No value specified: Try the ``external`` behavior.  If that fails,
    fall back to ``internal`` behavior.  *This is the default behavior.*
  * ``DIR``: Specify the location of a specific installation to use.
    ``configure`` will abort if it cannot find suitable header files
    and libraries under ``DIR``.

* ``--with-hwloc-libdir=LIBDIR``:
* ``--with-libevent-libdir=LIBDIR``:
* ``--with-prrte-libdir=LIBDIR``:
* ``--with-pmix-libdir=LIBDIR``:
  :ref:`See the configure CLI
  options conventions <building-ompi-cli-options-conventions-label>`
  for a description of these four options.

* ``--with-valgrind[=DIR]``:
  Directory where the valgrind software is installed.  If Open MPI
  finds Valgrind's header files, it will include additional support
  for Valgrind's memory-checking debugger.

  Valgrind support is disabled by default in Open MPI.  Enabling
  Valgrind support will eliminate a lot of false positives when
  running Valgrind on MPI applications.  There is a minor performance
  penalty for enabling this option.
